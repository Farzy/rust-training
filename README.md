# Rust Training

## Synopsis

Test program for the "**Learning Rust**" by Leo Tindall and "**Rust in Motion" by Carol Nichols / 
Jake Goulding tutorials on [O'Reilly Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com) and also the 
"[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)".

I use this project to practice Rust. There is no guideline in the code, I just add
modules while discovering features.

## Building

Code tested with Rust 1.43.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Testing

There are some sparse tests:

```bash
cargo test
```
## Benchmarking

If there is any benchmark: 

```bash
cargo bench
```
